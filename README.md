# A Chat-Bot answering queries of UT-Dallas Students

A verbal communication is the most natural way of interaction and the most convenient way of sharing the information. This interaction can be between two people or between a human and a bot, or a chat bot. This project presents a chat-bot system, that aims to generate relevant and well reasoned answers by understanding natural language elements of the user query in a restricted semantic and knowledge domain. It also aims to analyze the sentiments contained in the user query tokens. The knowledge corpus used to train is the information about the UT Dallas University and University library. The bot is an android application which supports voice communication by making use of android speech API. This project also introduces a well-structured knowledge representation that examines the user query patterns to provide a veritable response.
